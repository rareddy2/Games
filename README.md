# Games
This is a collection of some common games that I implemented using C/C++

## 2048 
Implemented a generalised version of the famous game 2048 (https://2048.ninja/). Instead of a 4x4 block, the implementation allows you to play an nxn game of 2048.

## Game_of_Life
C implementation of Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Uses an array of integers to depict the game.

## Game_of_Nim
Implementation of The Nim Number Game (https://education.jlab.org/nim/#:~:text=Nim%20is%20a%20game%20of,removes%20the%20last%20proton%20wins). The algorithm uses graphs to map the moves and uses machine learning to learn what move to make to win the game.
